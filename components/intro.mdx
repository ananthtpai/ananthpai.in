## ðŸŒ»Hi!

Iâ€™m **Ananth**, a **Full Stack Software Engineer**.
I spend most of my working time building web and mobile applications with React, NodeJS, React Native, and Typescript.
I love working on complex problem statements and figuring out the simplest and most innovative solutions.
At the moment, Iâ€™m working on getting better at algorithms, data structures and system design.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a huge F1 fan (go Ferrari!). I also love all things fitness, coffee, and food.
